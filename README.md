**Console-based Task Manager â€“ Java, OOP, File Serialization**

Designed and implemented a console-based Task Manager application using core Java and OOP principles.

Supported CRUD operations: Create, update, delete, and view tasks with fields like title, description, priority, status, and deadlines.

Used Enums for TaskPriority and TaskStatus to enforce valid task states and levels.

Implemented filtering and sorting of tasks by priority, status, and deadlines.

Added file persistence using Java Object Serialization, enabling tasks to be saved and restored across sessions.

Applied clean separation of concerns using a dedicated TaskManager service class and a Main driver class for menu-based input handling.

Ensured robustness through input parsing, equality checks, and file-safe loading.

Demonstrates strong understanding of LLD principles, object modeling, and console application architecture.
